Heroes of Pymoli Challenge – Kent Rodgers

Description
The Heroes of Pymoli challenge requires the student (me) to act as a Lead Analyst for an independent gaming company. The task is to organize and analyze the data from their most recent fantasy game Heroes of Pymoli. Like many others in its genre, the game is free-to-play, but players are encouraged to purchase optional items that enhance their playing experience. The primary task is to generate a report that breaks down the game's purchasing data into meaningful insights. The notebook includes the following tables: 
•	Player Count - Total Number of Players
•	Purchasing Analysis (Total)
o	 Number of Unique Items
o	Average Purchase Price
o	Total Number of Purchases
o	Total Revenue
•	Gender Demographics
o	Percentage and Count of Male Players
o	Percentage and Count of Female Players
o	Percentage and Count of Other / Non-Disclosed
